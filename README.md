## How to Git or Github
* Use [Github's GUI](https://desktop.github.com) to make your life easier
* Read tutorials
  * [Learn markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
  * [Make toy repositories](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)
  * ???
* Do not commit all your changes at once (often I'm guilty of doing this while I'm in a rush)!
  * Consider [splitting up your changes](http://stackoverflow.com/a/18531719) so it becomes easier to both
    * keep a nice history of commits
    * analyze each commit's purpose and results
  * Otherwise git becomes nothing more than a glorified Dropbox
